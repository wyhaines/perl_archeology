# perl archeology

This is a collection of a number of Perl libraries that I wrote in the 1999-2001
timeframe that I had thought lost forever. Some of it is perversely cool. Some
of it makes me weep.

Everythig but this specific README file is as I last left the code, for better
or for worse.

The ```sqlite``` directory contains Perl interface to sqlite from back when SQLite
was something new and shiny.

The ```misc``` directory is mostly stubs that I used for boilerplate stuff.

The ``DBD``` directory contains a DBD driver for Perl for SQLite, from a year-ish
before the first version hit CPAN.

The ```Enigo``` directory is a collection of libraries that were reused in
other projects. There is some fun stuff in here.
